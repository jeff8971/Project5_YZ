Windows 10 and run on Python 3.10.2.


## System Environment
- **IDE**: JetBrains PyCharm 2023.3.2 or any other Python IDE
- **Interpreter**: Python 3.10.2 or any compatible version
- **System Configuration**: Compatible with various operating systems, including macOS, Linux, and Windows.
- **Dependencies**: Requires OpenCV for image processing and feature extraction functionalities.

## Project Structure


## Features


## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
- Install [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) library.
- Install CMake.
- Ensure C++20 support in your compiler.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
```git clone https://github.com/jeff8971/Project4_YZ.git```
2. Navigate to the project directory:```cd Project5_YZ```



### Running the Applications

To train a MNIST network, run python3 ./train.py. This should build and train a new deep network and save the network to a file. To test the network on MNIST and your own handwritten data, run python3 ./test.py. To examine the first layer of the network, run python3 ./examine.py. To transfer the network to greek letters, run python3 ./transfer.py. To explore parameters of the MNIST network, run python3 ./design.py.
For extensions, I tried with more greek letters. Run python3 ./transfer.py to see the results.
